STATEMENT OF THE BUSINESS TASK.\n<p>The present study is the capsone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. For this Case Study, a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic believes that the key for future success relies on increasing the number of members. This company offers 3 types of purchase options: single-ride pass, full-day pass and an annual membership. In order to meet the objective of increasing the membership number, the marketing team asked an answer for these questions:\n\n* How can we better understand how anual members and casuals differ?\n* Why would casual riders buy a membership?\n* How digital media could affect marketing tactics?\n</p>\n\n## 2. DATA INFO\n<p>The company provided two types of datasets in a csv format, one was purchase information, in these case bike rides, containing id's, duration, starting and finishing location, member or casual and in some cases some information about the user. The other dataset contained information about the docking locations available, including an id for each location, position in coordinates, docking capacity, and inauguration date.\n    \nThe data available does not include information about prices or any information about the conditions of usage for a member or a casual rider, so at first glance, I can say that I find difficult to answer the second question: Why casuals riders would buy a membership? unless I collect independent data from a similar vehicle-sharing company and analyze the advantages they offer in a membership. The same goes for the third question: How digital media could affect their marketing tactics? I'll have to pull outside data too to evaluate the impact of social media in the marketing strategies.\n    \nWith the data available by the company, I could analyze how it's growth has happened, how differently do the riders use the bikes and the differences of usage by members and casuals, checking this way how much does the company rely on any one of them.\n<p/>\n\n## 3.
